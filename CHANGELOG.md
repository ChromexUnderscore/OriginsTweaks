  + No longer randomly activates after the resource runs out and cooldown has passed.
  + Cooldown is now visible using a pink resource bar with an X.

  + The Shader effect applied when the ability is used is now togglable with F4.
+ The Reflex ability's Cooldown Resource is now only visible when the Cooldown is active.
+ Fixed a typo in the Terrestria's wood and logs block tag which prevented it from loading.

#### [Version 1.15.1 [Diets Tweaks and Mod Compat]](https://github.com/ChromexUnderscore/OriginsTweaks/releases/tag/1.15.1)

+ Undone dependency metadata change listed in the previous release's changelog.

  + Mixed foods added by Farmer's Delight are ignored by both diets.
  + Added foods based off of feline prey such as chicken and fish to feline's saturation buff.
+ Fixed conditions for climbing inside cobwebs for the arachnid as this somehow granted the Arachnid Creative flight (confusion).
+ Reverted change of needing one free hand for the Arachnid's web shot, because this was just annoying to deal with when accidentally picking up stuff.
+ Added a proper name and description for Feline's natural Hunter Ability.
+ Fixed grammar mistakes in ``CHANGELOG.md``.
+ Enderian's Reflex Ability now requires you to sneak to avoid unwanted teleportation, for example when in caves.

  + I may fix this in the next release.
+ Changed Reflex in both nether and non-nether (Bug #35).
  + In the Overworld and below the nether-roof the Enderian may teleport up at most 16 blocks at a time.
